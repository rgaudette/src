Since the sensitivity of the DPDW waves decreases rapidly with depth and it
seems that the surface is much more succeptible to noise it might be useful to
weight the system in some way to take these affects into account.  I came up
with the approach while looking at Gorodnitsky's FOCUSS algorithm.

Using the standard min. norm approach FOCUSS generally found sparse solutions
of a few voxels very near the top of the medium.

This I feel is related to the noise near the surface observed in our
reconstructions.

Even using an "over-regularized" approach, that is picking the flat part of
the L-curve to heavily supress the noise did not make much of a difference.

In thinking about this I realized that this might be due to the large norm of
columns associated with shallow voxels.

Therefore, I first looked at normalizing the columns of the system such that
they would all have the same norm.  Given we have the system

     Ax = b

I accomplished this by substituting in Wq = x

     AWq = b

where W is the diagonal matrix

     W = diag(||A(:,i)||^-1)

Then finding the min. norm solution for q gives a weighted mon. norm solution
to the orginal problem

     q' = min ||q||  s.t. AWq' = b

therefore

     x' = min ||W^-1 x||  s.t. Ax = b

or
     x' = min ||diag(A,i) x||  s.t. Ax = b.

Therefore elements associated with large norm columns of A are forced smaller
than elements associated with small norm columns A.


Observations of CNTSVD

* no noise observations
  
* the inverse square root of the norm of the column seems to work better than
  the inverse norm of the column as a weight matrix.  The 

* which norm/residual to draw the L-curve over

* application of the CNTSVD to FOCUSS
