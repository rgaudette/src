I created this project to experiment with the BlackBoxOptim package that I am editing/developing at C:\Users\rick\.julia\dev\BlackBoxOptim. I added to to the project by `]add C:\\Users\\rick\\.julia\\dev\\BlackBoxOptim`.  But this is the most efficient workflow because any
* changes that I make in C:\Users\rick\.julia\dev\BlackBoxOptim I need to commit using git
* then I need to ]up BlackBoxOptim on this side.

I wonder if I `]dev C:\\Users\\rick\\.julia\\dev\\BlackBoxOptim` will that work better, that is will I see edits to C:\Users\rick\.julia\dev\BlackBoxOptim immediately?
