DISCLAIMER :

This is a Beta version of NOMAD 4.0.0. It represents work in progress and
subject to change without notice.


DESCRIPTION :

NOMAD is a C++ implementation of the Mesh Adaptive Direct Search (MADS)
algorithm, designed for constrained optimization of black-box functions.

The algorithms implemented are based on the book
"Derivative-Free and Blackbox Optimization", by Charles Audet and Warren Hare,
Springer 2017.

USAGE :

NOMAD 4 usage is similar to NOMAD 3, including batch and library modes. 


COMPILATION :

On Linux, Unix, and Mac OS X, NOMAD can be compiled using the makefile
located in the "src" directory.

Make options for Nomad 4:

If OpenMP is not available:
make NOOMP=1

To compile without using sgtelib:
make USE_SGTELIB=0

To compile in Debug mode:
make VARIANT=debug

The executable "nomad" will be produced to directory:
build/release/bin/  (build/debug/bin/ when in debug mode).


EXAMPLES :

Batch Mode:
There are examples in batch mode in examples/basic/batch/.
In each directory, the blackbox (usually named bb.exe) may be compiled using the
provided makefile.
The problem may be resolved using NOMAD and the parameter file param.txt:
nomad param.txt

Library Mode:
There are examples in library mode in examples/basic/library/.
In each directory, the executable may be compiled using the provided makefile
(using the same flags as for the NOMAD compilation). The problems may be resolved
by execution, for instance:
example_lib.exe
