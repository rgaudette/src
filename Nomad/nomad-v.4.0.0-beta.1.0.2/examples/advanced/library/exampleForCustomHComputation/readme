In this example, a modified version of infeasibility (H) computation 
for a given constraint replaces the default computation.

Providing a custom computation for H component can be used to:
- relax a constraint without changing the way BB outputs are 
  evaluated. The default bound can be replaced by a positive value to 
  relax a g(x)<0 constraint.
- change the computation of h. The default is h = sum(max(g_i,0)^2). 

A custom function must be provided. In this example, we have 
NOMAD::Double specialComputeHComponent
with arguments
( const NOMAD::BBOutputType & bbOutputType , size_t bboIndex, const NOMAD::Double &bbo ) 
In the main function, before running the MainStep we must call 
NOMAD::Eval::setComputeHComponent(specialComputeHComponent)
